To run the project template download zip file / clone repo and just 
	npm install - to install all node modules


1) Create a new project via ng new my-project --strict false (the --strict false part is important!)

2) Copy the content of the ZIP attachment src/app folder into the newly created project src/app folder.

3) Replace the files in files to replace directory

4) run npm install

5) Run your project (my-project) via ng serve

If you try to directly run the ZIP attachments, you must run npm install first.

If you're getting errors when running npm install, you can often solve them by running npm install --legacy-peer-deps instead of npm install.
